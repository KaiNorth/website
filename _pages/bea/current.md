## Workshop Description

The BEA Workshop is a leading venue for NLP innovation in the context of educational applications. It is one of the largest one-day workshops in the ACL community with over 80 attendees in the past several years. The growing interest in educational applications and a diverse community of researchers involved resulted in the creation of the Special Interest Group in Educational Applications (SIGEDU) in 2017, which currently has 191 members.

The workshop’s continuing growth highlights the alignment between societal needs and technological advances. NLP capabilities can now support an array of learning domains, including writing, speaking, reading, science, and mathematics, as well as the related intra-personal (e.g., self-confidence) and inter-personal (e.g., peer collaboration) skills. Within these areas, the community continues to develop and deploy innovative NLP approaches for use in educational settings. In the writing and speech domains, automated writing evaluation (AWE) and speech scoring applications, respectively, are commercially deployed in high-stakes assessment and in instructional contexts (e.g., Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and K-12 classrooms). Commercially-deployed plagiarism detection is also commonly used in both K-12 and higher education settings. For writing, the focus is on innovations that support writing tasks requiring source use, argumentative discourse, and factual content accuracy. For speech, there is an interest in advancing automated scoring to include the evaluation of discourse and content features in responses to spoken assessments. General advances in speech technology have promoted a renewed interest in spoken dialog and multimodal systems for instruction and assessment, for instance, for workplace interviews and simulated teaching environments. The explosive growth of mobile applications for game-based and simulation-based applications is another area where NLP has begun to play a large role, especially for language learning.

NLP for educational applications has gained visibility outside of the NLP community.  First, the Hewlett Foundation reached out to the public and private sectors and sponsored two competitions: one for automated essay scoring, and the other for scoring of short response items. The motivation driving these competitions was to engage the larger scientific community in this enterprise. [Learning @ Scale](https://learningatscale.acm.org) is a relatively new venue for NLP research in education.  MOOCs now incorporate AWE systems to manage several thousand assignments that may be received during a single MOOC course. MOOCs for Refugees have more recently emerged in response to the current social situations. Courses include language learning, and we can imagine that AWE and other NLP capabilities could support coursework. Another breakthrough for educational applications within the CL community is the presence of a number of shared-task competitions over the past several years &mdash; including four shared tasks on grammatical error detection and correction. NLP/Education shared tasks have seen new areas of research, such as the Automated Evaluation of Scientific Writing at [BEA 11](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/~tetreaul/naacl-bea11.html), Native Language Identification at [BEA 12](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/~tetreaul/emnlp-bea12.html), Second Language Acquisition Modelling and Complex Word Identification both at [BEA 13](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/~tetreaul/naacl-bea13.html), and Grammatical Error Correction at [BEA 14](/bea/14).  These competitions increased the visibility of, and interest in, our field.

The 15th BEA workshop will have oral presentation sessions, large poster session in order to maximize the amount of original work presented, as well as an exciting [invited talk](#invited-talk) by Mari Ostendorf. We expect that the workshop will continue to highlight novel technologies and opportunities for educational NLP in English as well as other languages. The workshop will solicit both full papers and short papers for either oral or poster presentation. We will solicit papers that incorporate NLP methods, including, but not limited to: automated scoring of open-ended textual and spoken responses; game-based instruction and assessment; educational data mining; intelligent tutoring; peer review; grammatical error detection and correction; learner cognition; spoken dialog; multimodal applications; tools for teachers and test developers; and use of corpora. Specific topics include:

**Automated scoring/evaluation for written student responses (across multiple genres)**
- Content analysis for scoring/assessment
- Detection and correction of grammatical and other types of errors
- Argumentation, discourse, sentiment, stylistic analysis, & non-literal language

**Intelligent Tutoring (IT), Collaborative Learning Environments**
- Educational Data Mining: Collection of user log data from educational applications
- Game-based learning
- Multimodal communication (including dialog systems) between students and computers

**Learner cognition**
- Assessment of learners' language and cognitive skill levels
- Systems that detect and adapt to learners' cognitive or emotional states
- Tools for learners with special needs

**Use of corpora in educational tools**
- Data mining of learner and other corpora for tool building
- Annotation standards and schemas / annotator agreement

**Tools and applications for classroom teachers and/or test developers**
- NLP tools for second and foreign language learners
- Semantic-based access to instructional materials to identify appropriate texts
- Tools that automatically generate test questions

## Submission Information

We will be using the ACL Submission Guidelines for the BEA Workshop this year. Authors are invited to submit a full paper of up to eight (8) pages of content, plus unlimited references; final versions of long papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 9 pages) so that reviewers' comments can be taken into account. We also invite short papers of up to of up to four (4) pages of content, plus unlimited references. Upon acceptance, short papers will be given five (5) content pages in the proceedings. Authors are encouraged to use this additional page to address reviewers' comments in their final versions.

Papers which describe systems are also invited to give a demo of their system. If you would like to present a demo in addition to presenting the paper, please make sure to select either "full paper + demo" or "short paper + demo" under "Submission Category" in the START submission page.

Previously published papers cannot be accepted. The submissions will be reviewed by the program committee. As reviewing will be blind, please ensure that papers are anonymous. Self-references that reveal the author's identity, e.g., "*We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...*", should be avoided. Instead, use citations such as "*Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...*".

We have also included conflict of interest in the submission form. You should mark all potential reviewers who have been authors on the paper, are from the same research group or institution, or who have seen versions of this paper or discussed it with you.

We will be using the START conference system to manage submissions: [https://www.softconf.com/acl2020/bea/](https://www.softconf.com/acl2020/bea/)

## Double Submission Policy
