Hi all, if you're new to this list, the BEA newsletter is something we've created to complement the BEA workshop: every month or two we'll send out an email with updates not only about the workshop, but on other EduNLP events and resources that you might want to know about.  Also, if you know of someone who should be added to the mailing list or if you wish to be removed, please send a note.  

In this newsletter we'll cover the following:
- BEA Information form (must read)
- BEA10 Announcements
- Upcoming EduNLP Conferences / Workshops
- EduNLP Publications from the last three months (big list!)

As always, I'd like to thank our new BEA Newsletter volunteers: Ekaterina Kochmar, Ildiko Pilan,  Somwya V. B. and Helen Yannakoudakis for assisting in the writing of this newsletter.  Thanks!  

And as always, if you know of any corpora, resources, tools, pubs, conferences, job postings, etc. that would be good to have on the newsletter, please let us know and they'll go in the next one.  

Joel & BEA Friends

## BEA Information Form

To date, this mailing list and the one used for reviewing has been manually constructed.  As the field has grown considerably over the last few years, it is sometimes hard to keep track of everyone's affiliations but also research interests, which helps us best match papers with appropriate reviewers.  To address this we've created a google form where you can submit your information and then it will be saved to a google spreadsheet which the BEA organizers can use for this newsletter but also for the workshop.  If you could please take 90 seconds to fill out the [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1-EJqurg9gm4ov8mc1OruuNq089b2d_fDef-fs1CeCGk/viewform), this will help us (and the field) considerably.

If you've done this a year or two before, please update this again.  We ask a few different questions and of course email addresses, affiliations, interests change.  If you know of others who would like to be added to the mailing list, please send them the above link.  Thanks!

## BEA10 Announcements

The [BEA10 workshop](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/~tetreaul/naacl-bea10.html) took place in Denver almost three months ago and it was a success!  We had one of the highest BEA participation numbers ever (58, the only other highest one was 63 but we also a hosted a shared task, so this is technically the largest BEA-only) and I think we were once again one of the largest one-day workshops at ACL.  This says a lot about the growth and strength of our field! The workshop featured a large list of sponsors, free t-shirts, and of course an energetic day of oral and poster presentations!   Further statistics and information can be found on the website and more specifically on the [opening remarks slides](http://www.cs.rochester.edu/~tetreaul/BEA10/00-BEA10-opening-remarks.ppt).

You'll also note that in the Workshop Program section, we've listed links to the papers as well as the slides.  If you're an author and haven't sent me your materials, or have auxiliary materials you'd like me to post, just send an email.  I know a few people sent in their posters to me, I'm putting those up this week.

I also took a few [photos](https://picasaweb.google.com/108703769346345807667/BEA10PosterSessionJune042015) at the BEA10 poster session.
