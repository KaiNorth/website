As we are part of the International Alliance to Advance Learning in the Digital Era ([IAALDE](https://alliancelss.com/)), every year we select an ambassador paper that will represent our society (SIGEDU) at another conference affiliated with a "sister" society from IAALDE. All BEA workshop attendees can vote for their favorite ambassador paper (either an oral presentation or a poster).

The following paper was voted the ambassador paper at the [17th BEA workshop](https://sig-edu.org/bea/2022):
