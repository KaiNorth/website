Hi all, 
It's only fitting to close out the year with a BEA newsletter. This one has everything:

- BEA11 Announcements
- AESW Shared Task (new!)
- EduNLP in the News (new!)
- Resources
- EduNLP Publications
- Upcoming EduNLP conferences and workshops

I'd like to thank Ekaterina Kochmar, Ildiko Pilan, Sowmya V. B.  and  Helen Yannakoudakis for once again helping with putting together another information packed newsletter.  And as always, if you know of someone who would want to be on the email list, please have them fill out the [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1-EJqurg9gm4ov8mc1OruuNq089b2d_fDef-fs1CeCGk/viewform).

Hope you have a good start to the new year and look forward to seeing you in 2016!

Best,
Joel & BEA Friends

## BEA11 Announcements

As noted in the prior newsletter, BEA11 will be taking place in San Diego, June 16, the day after the main NAACL main conference.  The deadline for submissions is March 08 EST.  We hope you can submit!

If you are a reviewer for this year's BEA, we will be sending you an email over the next week from the START / SOFTCONF system so you can be registered into the system.  Please follow the steps in the link and accept the invitation.

## AESW Shared Task

We are pleased to announce that the first edition of the *Automated Evaluation of Scientific Writing* Shared Task on grammatical error detection will be co-located with BEA11 this year. The Shared Task, led by Vidas Daudaravicius, will be organized independently from the BEA11. System description papers submitted and accepted to the AESW Shared Task will be presented as posters at the BEA Poster Session. In addition, the AESW organizers will summarize the results of the Shared Task in an oral presentation during the BEA. For more information on the task, as well as important dates and submission information, please go [here](http://textmining.lt/aesw/index.html). Registration closes February 1st.

## EduNLP in the News 

This is a new category. I wanted to include some links to articles I came across that involved our field in the news and popular culture.  If you see something of note when you're surfing the web or doing research for your work, please email in the link!

- *Software is smart enough for SAT, but still far from intelligent*, [NYTimes](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/21/technology/personaltech/software-is-smart-enough-for-sat-but-still-far-from-intelligent.html?_r=1)

## Resources

- Radu Ionesci and Marius Popescu are releasing their [string kernel code](http://string-kernels.herokuapp.com) under the GNU open source license. This method was used in their EMNLP 2014 paper to get the highest (to date) native language identification performance on the TOEFL11.  

- [Jazzy: Java Open Source Spell Checker](http://jazzy.sourceforge.net): *a modeling language that expedites the development of learning based programs, designed for use with the Java programming language* (used eg, in *Generating Confusion Sets for Context-Sensitive Error Correction*, Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010).
