Dear BEA community,

We would like to share a job advertisement: [Tenure-Stream Assistant Professor of Artificial Intelligence and Learning Science](https://cfopitt.taleo.net/careersection/pitt_faculty_external/jobdetail.ftl?job=23007623&tz=GMT-04%3A00&tzname=America%2FNew_York) at 
University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA USA.

### About the Position
The [School of Computing and Information (SCI)](https://www.sci.pitt.edu/) and [Learning Research and Development Center (LRDC)](https://www.lrdc.pitt.edu/) at [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.pitt.edu/) seek to hire a faculty member at the rank of Assistant Professor (SCI) and Research Scientist (LRDC) at the confluence of Artificial Intelligence and Learning Science. The position builds on SCIâ€™s ongoing initiative and faculty hiring that prioritizes scholarship on the use of learning technology to further social justice outcomes. This role requires experience in advancing technology-oriented educational approaches and outcomes through the development and application of AI methods including large language models, generative AI, and other foundational AI approaches. The ideal candidate will also have an interest in learning sciences, including but not limited to the study of student and teacher learning, broadly construed, and in scholarship on social justice, including but not limited to learning processes, practices, and outcomes for minoritized populations, principles for responsible and equitable AI in education, and community-engaged scholarship. In sum, the individual filling this position is expected to engage in research that considers, improves, or creates state-of-the-art AI-centric learning science to address societal problems, including supporting learning for all, deepening social impact, and improving lives. 

We seek candidates who are interested in exploring how AI and learning science can analyze and 
affect mechanisms within the social structure, such as cultural symbols, rules of behavior, 
social organizations, or value systems that influence learning. We seek transdisciplinary 
researchers who have a strong interest in working across other areas such as Africana Studies, Natural and Physical Sciences, Communications, Education, Psychology, Health Sciences, Gender Studies, Law, Medicine, Social Science, or Social Work. Additionally, we seek researchers with a strong background in engaging historically excluded communities in the development, application, and evaluation of AI technologies in learning spaces.

SCI and LRDC strongly encourage applications from women, underrepresented, and minoritized candidates. We are especially interested in candidates with a demonstrated commitment to working with students from diverse backgrounds, as well as those whose research, teaching, and service align with our diversity values and aim to address societal issues.

### Required Qualifications
* Candidates must have earned a Ph.D. or equivalent degree (e.g., Doctor of Law) prior to the appointment, in an area relevant to Artificial Intelligence and Learning Science 

* Candidates must possess at least three years of relevant experience in research, teaching, community work, technology innovation, or equivalent areas

* Candidates must have a commitment to advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion

* Interest in interdisciplinary, impactful work, and collaboration in AI and learning science

### Preferred Qualifications
* A relevant scholarly record including but not limited to publication quality, teaching portfolio, technology products, and/or history of community advocacy

* Interest in supporting a learning and social change agenda
