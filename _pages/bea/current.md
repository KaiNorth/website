## Workshop Description

The BEA Workshop is a leading venue for NLP innovation in the context of educational applications. It is one of the largest one-day workshops in the ACL community with over 100 registered attendees in the past several years. The growing interest in educational applications and a diverse community of researchers involved resulted in the creation of the [Special Interest Group in Educational Applications (SIGEDU)](https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=2019Q3_Reports:_SIGEDU) in 2017, which currently has 240 members.

The workshop’s continuing growth highlights the alignment between societal needs and technological advances: for instance, BEA16 in 2021 hosted a panel discussion on New Challenges for Educational Technology in the Time of the Pandemic addressing the pressing issues around COVID19. NLP capabilities can now support an array of learning domains, including writing, speaking, reading, science, and mathematics, as well as the related intra-personal (e.g., self-confidence) and inter-personal (e.g., peer collaboration) skills. Within these areas, the community continues to develop and deploy innovative NLP approaches for use in educational settings. Another breakthrough for educational applications within the CL community is the presence of a number of shared-task competitions organized by the BEA workshop over the past several years, including four shared tasks on grammatical error detection and correction alone. NLP/Education shared tasks have also seen new areas of research, such as the Automated Evaluation of Scientific Writing at BEA11, Native Language Identification at BEA12, Second Language Acquisition Modelling at BEA13, and Complex Word Identification at BEA13. These competitions increased the visibility of, and interest in, our field. 

The 17th BEA workshop will have keynotes by Burr Settles (Duolingo) and Alexandra Cristea (University of Durham), an invited paper presentation by a member of one of the educational societies from the International Alliance to Advance Learning in the Digital Era (IAALDE), oral presentation sessions, a large poster session to maximize the amount of original work presented, and a panel discussion to encourage interaction between workshop participants. We expect that the workshop will continue to highlight novel technologies and opportunities for educational NLP in English as well as other languages. The workshop will solicit both full papers and short papers for either oral or poster presentation. 

We will solicit papers that incorporate NLP methods, including, but not limited to: 
- automated scoring of open-ended textual and spoken responses;
- automated scoring/evaluation for written student responses (across multiple genres);
- game-based instruction and assessment; 
- educational data mining; 
- intelligent tutoring; 
- collaborative learning environments;
- peer review; 
- grammatical error detection and correction; 
- learner cognition; 
- spoken dialog; 
- multimodal applications;
- annotation standards and schemas;
- tools and applications for classroom teachers, learners and/or test developers; and 
- use of corpora in educational tools. 


## Invited Talks

- **Burr Settles, Duolingo**

  [Burr Settles](http://burrsettles.com/) is Research Director at Duolingo, the world’s largest language-learning platform. He is also the author of "Active Learning," a text on adaptive machine learning algorithms. His research has been published in Cognitive Science, NeurIPS, ICML, ACL, EMNLP, AAAI, and KDD, and has been covered by The New York Times, Forbes, WIRED, and the BBC. Previously, Burr was a postdoc at Carnegie Mellon and earned a PhD from UW-Madison.

- **Alexandra Cristea, University of Durham**

  [Alexandra I. Cristea](https://www.durham.ac.uk/staff/alexandra-i-cristea/) is Professor, Deputy Head, Director of Research and Head of the Artificial Intelligence in Human Systems research group in the Department of Computer Science at Durham University. She is Advisory Board Member at the Ustinov College, N8 CIR Digital Humanities team lead for Durham. She is Honorary Professor at the Computer Science Department, Warwick University. Her research includes web science, learning analytics, user modelling and personalisation, semantic web, social web, authoring. Especially, her work on frameworks for adaptive systems has influenced many researchers and is highly cited.
