Hi all, hope you are all doing well!  The sixth BEA newsletter contains the following:

- BEA10 Announcements
- Upcoming EduNLP Conferences / Workshops
- EduNLP Resources
- Recent EduNLP Publications

I'd like to thank our new BEA Newsletter volunteers: Ekaterina Kochmar, Ildiko Pilan and Somwya V. B.  for massively assisting in the writing of this newsletter.  Thanks!  

As always, if you know of any corpora, resources, tools, pubs, conferences, etc. that would be good to have on the newsletter, please let us know and they'll go in the next one.  

Have a great new year and see you in 2015!

Joel

## BEA10 Announcements
The dates for the 10th Workshop on Innovative Use of NLP for Building Educational Applications, co-located with NAACL-HLT 2015 in Denver, USA, have been set:

- Submission Deadline: March 08 - 23:59 EST (New York City Time)
- Notification of Acceptance: March 24
- Camera-ready Papers Due: April 03
- Workshop: June 04

Also note that we differ slightly from the NAACL submission guidelines in that long papers are 9 pages and short paper are 5 pages.  There will be no additional page for revisions.  

As this is the tenth edition of the workshop which is very exciting, we are also soliciting papers which are retrospectives on the field or parts of the field and also forward-looking papers which describe your thoughts on how the field should progress or new directions it should take.  We hope you submit some!

Finally, we are also soliciting sponsors for the BEA this year.  Contributions will go towards an invited speaker, dinner for students attending the workshop and t-shirts.  If you or your institution are interested in becoming a sponsor please email us back at this address.  Gold level sponsorship is $250USD, silver level is $100USD.

## Recent EduNLP Publications

2014 was yet another banner year for EduNLP publications.  We've gone through the last six months of conferences and workshops in the ACL Anthology and pulled out the ones that seemed most relevant to the community that you might want to know about.  In addition, we've done some web searching and found papers outside the Anthology that are also relevant.  Enjoy.
