# AIED Intelligent Textbooks Workshop

This is the final call for papers for the 2023 AIED Workshop on Intelligent Textbooks
(Notice: the deadlines have been extended)

Fifth Workshop on Intelligent Textbooks
@ The 24th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED’2023)

We are happy to announce that we will be organizing a full-day workshop at AIED 2023.
The date of the workshop is July 3, 2023.
AIED 2023 will be held in Tokio, Japan during July 3-7, 2023.
See here: https://www.aied2023.org/

## WORKSHOP DESCRIPTION 
Textbooks have evolved over the last several decades in many aspects. Most textbooks can be accessed online, many of them freely. They often come with libraries of supplementary educational resources or online educational services built on top of them. As a result of these enrichments, new research challenges and opportunities emerge that call for the application of AIED methods to enhance digital textbooks and learners’ interaction with them. Therefore, we ask: How to facilitate access to textbooks and improve the reading process? What can be extracted from textbook content and data-mined from the logs of students interacting with it? How can we use large language models to support the development and usage of textbooks? This workshop seeks research contributions addressing these and other research questions related to the idea of intelligent textbooks. It aims at bringing together researchers working on different aspects of learning technologies to establish intelligent textbooks as a new, interdisciplinary research field.
More information is available on the workshop website: https://intextbooks.science.uu.nl/workshop2023/

This workshop builds on the success of the four previous events:
+ 2022: https://intextbooks.science.uu.nl/workshop2022/
+ 2021: https://intextbooks.science.uu.nl/workshop2021/
+ 2020: https://intextbooks.science.uu.nl/workshop2020/
+ 2019: http://ml4ed.cc/2019-AIED-workshop/

## TOPICS OF INTEREST
The workshop themes include but are not limited to:
+ Modeling and representation of textbooks: examining the prerequisite and the semantic structure of textbooks to enhance their readability;
+ Analysis and mining of textbook usage logs: analyzing the patterns of learners’ use of textbooks to obtain insights on learning and the pedagogical value of textbook content;
+ Generation, manipulation, and presentation: exploring and testing different formats and forms of textbook content to find the most effective means of presenting different knowledge;
+ Assessment and personalization: developing methods that can generate assessments and enhance textbooks with adaptive support to meet the needs of every learner using the textbook;
+ Knowledge visualization: augmenting textbooks with concept maps, open learner models and other knowledge-rich extensions
+ Collaborative technologies: building and deploying social components of digital textbooks that enable learners to interact with not only content but other learners;
+ Smart interactive content: extending online textbooks with various kinds of smart interactive content to improve learning, engagement, learner modeling, and personalization
+ Intelligent information retrieval and question-answering for digital textbooks
+ Content curation and enrichment: sorting through external resources on the web and finding the relevant resources to augment the textbook and provide additional information for learners.
