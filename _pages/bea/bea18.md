## Workshop Description

The BEA Workshop is a leading venue for NLP innovation in the context of educational applications. It is one of the largest one-day workshops in the ACL community with over 100 registered attendees in the past several years. The growing interest in educational applications and a diverse community of researchers involved resulted in the creation of the [Special Interest Group in Educational Applications (SIGEDU)](https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=2019Q3_Reports:_SIGEDU) in 2017, which currently has over 300 members.

The workshop’s continuing growth highlights the alignment between societal needs and technological advances: for instance, BEA16 in 2021 hosted a panel discussion on New Challenges for Educational Technology in the Time of the Pandemic addressing the pressing issues around COVID19. NLP capabilities can now support an array of learning domains, including writing, speaking, reading, science, and mathematics, as well as the related intra-personal (e.g., self-confidence) and inter-personal (e.g., peer collaboration) skills. Within these areas, the community continues to develop and deploy innovative NLP approaches for use in educational settings. Another breakthrough for educational applications within the CL community is the presence of a number of shared-task competitions organized by the BEA workshop over the past several years, including four shared tasks on grammatical error detection and correction alone. NLP/Education shared tasks have also seen new areas of research, such as the Automated Evaluation of Scientific Writing at BEA11, Native Language Identification at BEA12, Second Language Acquisition Modelling at BEA13, and Complex Word Identification at BEA13. These competitions increased the visibility of, and interest in, our field.

The 18th BEA workshop will follow the format of BEA in 2022 and will be hybrid. We will have three invited talks, a shared task on generation of teacher responses in educational dialogues, oral presentation sessions, and a large poster session to maximize the amount of original work presented. We expect that the workshop will continue to highlight novel technologies and opportunities, including the use of state-of-the-art large language models in educational applications, and challenges around responsible AI for educational NLP, in English as well as other languages. The workshop will solicit both full papers and short papers for either oral or poster presentation. We will solicit papers that incorporate NLP methods, including, but not limited to: automated scoring of open-ended textual and spoken responses; game-based instruction and assessment; educational data mining; intelligent tutoring; peer review; grammatical error detection and correction; learner cognition; spoken dialog; multimodal applications; tools for teachers and test developers; and use of corpora. We will solicit papers that incorporate NLP methods, including, but not limited to:

- automated scoring of open-ended textual and spoken responses;
- automated scoring/evaluation for written student responses (across multiple genres);
- game-based instruction and assessment;
- educational data mining;
- intelligent tutoring;
- collaborative learning environments;
- peer review;
- grammatical error detection and correction;
- learner cognition;
- spoken dialog;
- multimodal applications;
- annotation standards and schemas;
- tools and applications for classroom teachers, learners and/or test developers; and
- use of corpora in educational tools.

<i>Building Educational Applications using NLP: A Measurement Perspective</i>

**Abstract:** The domains of NLP, data science, software engineering, and educational measurement are becoming increasingly interdependent when creating NLP-based educational applications. Indeed, the domains themselves are merging in key ways, with each incorporating one another's methods and tools into their work. For example, many software engineers regularly deploy machine learning models and many linguists, data scientists, and measurement staff regularly develop software. Even so, each discipline approaches this complex task with the assumptions, priorities, and values of their field. The best educational applications are the result of multi-disciplinary teams that can leverage one another's strengths and can recognize and honor the values of each disciplinary perspective.<br/>
This talk will describe the educational measurement perspective within this collaborative process. At a high level, educational measurement is the design, use, and analysis of assessments in order to make inferences about what students know and can do. Given this, the measurement experts on a team focus heavily on defining what students need to know and do, what evidence supports inferences about what students know and can do, and whether the data are accurate, reliable, and fair to all students. This perspective can impact the full life-cycle development of educational applications, from designing the core product focus, data collection activities, NLP modelling, analysis of model outputs, and information provided to students. It can also help ensure that educational applications produce information that is valuable to teachers and students. Because these perspectives can be opaque to those outside of measurement, the development process of various NLP educational tools will be used to illustrate key areas where measurement can contribute in product design.

<i>Interrupting Linguistic Bias in Written Communication with NLP tools</i>

**Abstract:** Unconscious bias is hard to detect, but when we identify it in language usage, we can take steps to interrupt and reduce it. At Textio, we focus on using NLP to detect, interrupt, and educate writers about bias in written workforce communications. Unconscious bias affects many facets of the employee lifecycle. Exclusionary language in recruiting communications can deter candidates from diverse backgrounds from even applying to a position, hindering efforts to build inclusive workplaces. Once a candidate has accepted a position, the language used to provide them feedback on their performance affects how they develop professionally, and we have found stark inequities in the language of feedback to members of different demographic groups. This talk will discuss how Textio uses NLP to interrupt these patterns of bias by assessing these texts for bias and providing 1) real-time iterative, educational feedback to the writer on how to improve a specific document, including guidance toward less-biased language alternatives, and 2) an assessment at a workplace level of exclusionary and inclusive language, so that companies can set goals around language improvement and track their progress toward them.

**Bio:** Jordana Heller, PhD, is Director of Data Intelligence at Textio, a tech company focused on interrupting bias in performance feedback and recruiting. Textio identifies bias in written documents and provides data to writers in real time that helps them write more effectively and equitably. At Textio, Jordana applies her background as a computational psycholinguist and cognitive scientist to her leadership of R&D teams who are focused on using data and NLP to help employers reduce bias and accelerate professional growth equitably.

<i>Generating Teacher Responses in Educational Dialogues: The AI Teacher Test & BEA 2023 Shared Task</i>

**Abstract:** How can we test whether state-of-the-art generative models, such as Blender and GPT-3, are good AI teachers, capable of replying to a student in an educational dialogue? Designing an AI teacher test is challenging: although evaluation methods are much-needed, there is no off-the-shelf solution to measuring pedagogical ability. <br/>
In the first part of this talk, I will describe our paper *The AI Teacher Test: Measuring the Pedagogical Ability of Blender and GPT-3 in Educational Dialogues* presented at EDM 2022. The paper reported on a first attempt at an AI teacher test. We built a solution around the insight that you can run conversational agents in parallel to human teachers in real-world dialogues, simulate how different agents would respond to a student, and compare these counterpart responses in terms of three abilities: speak like a teacher, understand a student, help a student. Our method builds on the reliability of comparative judgments in education and uses a probabilistic model and Bayesian sampling to infer estimates of pedagogical ability. We find that, even though conversational agents (Blender in particular) perform well on conversational uptake, they are quantifiably worse than real teachers on several pedagogical dimensions, especially with regard to helpfulness. <br>
In the second part of this talk, I will describe the results of the *BEA 2023 Shared Task on Generating AI Teacher Responses in Educational Dialogues*, which was a continuation of our EDM paper.

### Shared Task

**Webpage**: [https://sig-edu.org/sharedtask/2023](/sharedtask/2023)

The workshop will host a shared task on generation of teacher responses in educational dialogues. Participants will be provided with teacher–student dialogue samples from the Teacher Student Chatroom Corpus (Caines et al., 2020) of real-world teacher–student interactions and will be asked to generate teacher responses using NLP and AI methods. Submissions will be ranked according to automated evaluation metrics, with the top submissions selected for further human evaluation. Given active participation in the previous BEA-hosted shared tasks, we expect to attract around 20 participating teams.

**Organizers**: Anaïs Tack, KU Leuven, imec; Ekaterina Kochmar, MBZUAI; Zheng Yuan, King’s College London; Serge Bibauw, Universidad Central del Ecuador; Chris Piech, Stanford University
