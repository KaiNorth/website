Hi all, hope you are having a nice start to the new year.  The 8th BEA newsletter contains the following:

- BEA10 Announcements
- Upcoming EduNLP Conferences
- Job Openings (via Hwee Tou Ng)
- Recent EduNLP publications
- Resources

I'd like to thank our BEA Newsletter volunteers: Ekaterina Kochmar, Ildiko Pilan,  Somwya V. B. and Helen Yannakoudakis for once again massively assisting in the writing of this newsletter.  Thanks!  

As always, if you know of any corpora, resources, tools, pubs, conferences, job postings, etc. that would be good to have on the newsletter, please let us know and they'll go in the next one.  

Finally, at the NLP4CALL Workshop this past month, they put out a [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1tQbHBgZoOG-N88yUt4mIoZ7YJUplbm5HO7ignDrajzM/viewform?usp=send_form) to get a handle on the research interests and goals people had for the field.  If you have a moment, please fill it out. 

Joel & BEA Friends

## BEA10 Announcements

We're getting excited for the 10th edition of the BEA!  We are one of only a handful of workshops in the *CL universe that have made it to a tenth edition which is a wonderful achievement.  To add to it, we had a record number of submissions to BEA10, and the workshop is looking like it might be one of the largest in its history.  We're looking forward to seeing you in Denver on Thursday, June 04.  Some notes for people attending and presenting:

* You can find the workshop schedule (and thus list of accepted papers) [here](http://www.cs.rochester.edu/~tetreaul/naacl-bea10.html#program).

* We will be having our world-famous post-workshop dinner following the workshop that night.  Please consider sticking around Denver another day to attend!  

* For presenters, we will be following the NAACL2015 instructions, so please check them out.  The only differences are that 1) short paper oral presentations get 20min (15min content, 5min Q/A), and 2) the presentations will not be video'd.  Instructions are [here](http://naacl.org/naacl-hlt-2015/presentation-instructions.html).

* We are fortunate to have many sponsors this year.  This goes towards our free workshop t-shirt (free with registration) and defrays the cost of dinner for students.  The gold level sponsors are Appen, McGraw-Hill Education/CTB, Educational Testing Service, Grammarly, Turnitin Lightside Labs, Pacific Metrics and Pearson.  And American Institutes for Research is a silver level sponsor! 

* Yes we have a whole new design for the BEA T-shirts.  You will get a shirt when you go up to register.  Go early to get the size you want!
