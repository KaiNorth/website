Hi all, Happy New Year ... or belated Valentines Day.  The BEA workshop would like to show its love with the latest newsletter :)  In this edition we have put together a list of all the upcoming EduNLP (and related) conferences, workshops and shared tasks as well as pointers to resources and papers that came out in the last few months.

I'd like to thank our new BEA Newsletter volunteers: Ekaterina Kochmar, Ildiko Pilan,  Somwya V. B. and Helen Yannakoudakis for assisting in the writing of this newsletter.  Thanks!  

As always, if you know of any corpora, resources, tools, pubs, conferences, job postings, etc. that would be good to have on the newsletter, please let us know and they'll go in the next one.  

Joel & BEA Friends
