Hi all, hope you're having a good start to 2018!  As some of you may have noticed, 2017 was a banner year for the workshop. We had the largest number of submissions and attendees ever at BEA12 and, according to [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en&vq=eng_computationallinguistics), the BEA workshop actually ranks 19th among all NLP publication venues (conferences, journals, workshops, etc)!

So well done everyone, and thank you Marek Rei and others for emailing us about this! In 2018, we have several important developments.  First we are launching elections for positions in the new Special Interest Group for Education and NLP (SIGEDU), and we are launching a new website. We have some other important notes to share with you (see list below), but if you do one thing, please [register](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSep9q-QLIvCIVIcdyoJJA8y2Ql32YRCQfVWDNJx1FwNXD3L6Q/viewform) to be a member of the SIG and consider running for a SIGEDU officer position.

In this edition of the newsletter, we will talk about:
- SIG Membership
- SIG Elections
- BEA13 Workshop Important Dates
- Shared Tasks
- Job Advertisement: Faculty Position @ UPitt LRDC
- Job Advertisement: Faculty Position @ JHU CLSP

Please fill out the SIG Membership form and, if applicable, the SIGEDU nomination form by Friday, February 9. I also know this is a bit of a mass emailing, apologies in advance if you do not wish to be included on these emails.  Just let us know.

Best,
Joel & the SIGEDU team

## SIGEDU Membership

Now that we are officially a special interest group, we need to maintain a membership list.  There are no commitments here except members get to vote in elections and it makes it easier for the organization to reach out for help and solicit advice from the community.  If you could take 60 seconds to fill out this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSep9q-QLIvCIVIcdyoJJA8y2Ql32YRCQfVWDNJx1FwNXD3L6Q/viewform), it would help immensely!

## SIGEDU Officer Nominations

Next, we need to hold elections for officers (President, Secretary, Treasurer, and Executive Board Members).  Officers are elected for two years and help grow the organization and help run the workshop. The goal is to more formally get others as a part of the organization and make the SIG a self-sustaining organization that can really expand the field of Education and NLP!  If you are interested in running (and we encourage you to do so!!) please submit your name through this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfB-pexjsSZZz5BzyoIzd3EPzsxJaO6oc7j3m5fGUgr_fFkFA/viewform).

If you know someone who would be good for this role, please let us know via [email](mailto:bea.nlp.workshop@gmail.com). Once we have a list of candidates, we will ask them to send us a statement and bio and hold elections. Our plan is to hold the elections end of February / beginning of March. More details about each position follow.

## BEA13 Workshop

The 13th edition of the BEA workshop will take place in New Orleans in June 05.  The submission deadline is March 20 and we hope to see you there.  More information can be found [on the website](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/~tetreaul/naacl-bea13.html).

Also, if you are interested in sponsoring the workshop, please [email us](mailto:bea.nlp.workshop@gmail.com) for more information.

## Shared Tasks Galore!

For the first time ever, the BEA will be hosting two shared tasks.  We are really excited about both of them and hope you can participate.  Training data has been released for both recently.

### Second Language Acquisition Modeling

The Shared Task on Second Language Acquisition Modeling (SLAM) makes use of data provided by Duolingo, a popular free online computer-aided language learning (CALL) platform. Teams will be provided with "traces" of all translation and transcription exercises from 800+ language learners — annotated for errors — spanning their first 100 days of activity on Duolingo. The task is then to predict errors made by a held-out set of 100+ language learners over their first 100 days. There will be four tracks for learners of English, Spanish, French and German. We believe that this task presents several new and interesting dimensions for research in Second Language Acquisition modeling: (1) subjects are mostly beginners in their respective L2s, (2) success will likely require teams to model learning — and forgetting — over time, and (3) teams are encouraged to use features which generalize across a variety of languages (hence 4 tracks). You can find more details on the [task website](http://sharedtask.duolingo.com/).

### Complex Word Identification

The other competition is the Shared Task on Complex Word Identification.  Over the past decade a number of studies have been published on automatic text simplification (Specia, 2010; Saggion et al. 2015; Štajner, 2015). Text simplification systems aim to facilitate reading comprehension to different target readerships such as foreign language learners, and native speakers with low literacy levels or various kinds of reading impairments. Two main factors that impact reading comprehension addressed by these systems are lexical complexity and syntactic complexity.

Many lexical simplification systems have been proposed up to this date (Glavaš and Štajner, 2015; Paetzold and Specia, 2016). It has been shown that those systems which have a separate complex word identification (CWI) module at the beginning of their pipeline outperform those systems which treat all words as potentially complex (Paetzold and Specia, 2015). Therefore, automatic identification of words that are difficult for a given target population is an important step for building better performing lexical simplification systems. This step is known as complex word identification (CWI) (Shardlow, 2013).

The first edition of the CWI challenge included only English data aimed at non-native English speakers, whereas the second edition will feature a multilingual dataset (Yimam, 2017a, 2017b) and four individual tracks: (1) English monolingual CWI, (2) Spanish monolingual CWI, (3) German monolingual CWI, (4) Multilingual CWI with a French test set. More details are available on the [task website](https://sites.google.com/view/cwisharedtask2018/).
